        - text-based - means all type of data is working on it.
        - data exchange - json kihelp se ek server se dusre server me or ek programming language se dusri programming ke andar data ko exchange kar sakte he data structuring ke liye (like - search, update, delete, add)

    - it is mainly used to exchange data between a server and web application.

script notation) and only js inherit json thats why we  say json only
